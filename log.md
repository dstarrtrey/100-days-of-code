# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 24, 2019
##### Redux Beginnings

**Today's Progress**: Completed first 12 of freeCodeCamp's Redux challenges, emphasizing understanding over completion.

**Thoughts:** Redux is completely new to me, and the functionality of it was a little unclear. I'll need to do some reading on states and the uses for Redux. I was also floored by JavaScript switches and completely forgot them! I'll have to review those, they're definitely more readable and pretier than conditionals.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
