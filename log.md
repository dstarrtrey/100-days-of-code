# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 24, 2019
##### Redux Beginnings

**Today's Progress**: Completed first 12 of freeCodeCamp's Redux challenges, emphasizing understanding over completion.

**Thoughts:** Redux is completely new to me, and the functionality of it was a little unclear. I'll need to do some reading on states and the uses for Redux. I was also floored by JavaScript switches and completely forgot them! I'll have to review those, they're definitely more readable and pretier than conditionals.

### Day 2: January 25, 2019
##### Python: The Return

**Today's Progress**: Completed first 9 challenges for HackerRank's Python language proficiency. 

**Thoughts**: It's been almost 4 years exactly since fighting to learn basic Python for a web scraper, Flo Sho, with Brad and Kristina. In my job listing perusing yesterday, I noticed a lot of jobs that asked for Ruby, C#, or Python in addition to JavaScript, and remembered Python, and I thought it would be more valuable for me to revisit than C++ as a web developer. The syntax kicked my butt! It was tough getting there but I think it will be helpful in the scope of #100DaysOfCode.

### Day 3: January 27, 2019
##### Chessboard Progress!

**Today's Progress**: Decent organization set up for ChessBoard App!

**Thoughts**: I missed yesterday, but ended up being so engrossed that I spent like 2 hours on it! Python felt like it would be too difficult for something that might not prove useful. The Chessboard would be a great centerpiece for my portfolio!

##### Intro to React

**Today's Progress**: A bunch of React challenges on freeCodeCamp!

**Thoughts**: I forgot to start the timer today so I think I did a LOT more than I might have needed to. Not a bad thing at all! I'm understanding it and seeing its uses! This is gonna be powerful.

### Day 11: February 5, 2019
##### Continuing React

**Today's Progress**: A few more challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Challenges got a little tougher today with a lot of reading included. I am beginning to feel more comfortable with the library, but not enough to understand making my own projects with it.

### Day 12: Febrary 6, 2019
##### React again

**Today's Progress**: Some more freeCodeCamp challenges!

**Thoughts**: It's getting a little boring to do, might try a different site tomorrow to see if I'm starting to understand it. Might need more resources to see it in action.
