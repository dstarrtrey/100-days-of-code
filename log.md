# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 24, 2019
##### Redux Beginnings

**Today's Progress**: Completed first 12 of freeCodeCamp's Redux challenges, emphasizing understanding over completion.

**Thoughts:** Redux is completely new to me, and the functionality of it was a little unclear. I'll need to do some reading on states and the uses for Redux. I was also floored by JavaScript switches and completely forgot them! I'll have to review those, they're definitely more readable and pretier than conditionals.

### Day 2: January 25, 2019
##### Python: The Return

**Today's Progress**: Completed first 9 challenges for HackerRank's Python language proficiency. 

**Thoughts**: It's been almost 4 years exactly since fighting to learn basic Python for a web scraper, Flo Sho, with Brad and Kristina. In my job listing perusing yesterday, I noticed a lot of jobs that asked for Ruby, C#, or Python in addition to JavaScript, and remembered Python, and I thought it would be more valuable for me to revisit than C++ as a web developer. The syntax kicked my butt! It was tough getting there but I think it will be helpful in the scope of #100DaysOfCode.

### Day 1: January 27, 2019
##### Chessboard Progress!

**Today's Progress**: Decent organization set up for ChessBoard App!

**Thoughts** I missed yesterday, but ended up being so engrossed that I spent like 2 hours on it! Python felt like it would be too difficult for something that might not prove useful. The Chessboard would be a great centerpiece for my portfolio!
